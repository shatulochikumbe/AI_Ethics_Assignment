# POLICY GUIDELINES: ETHICAL AI IN HEALTHCARE
## PLP Academy Community Proposal

### 1. PATIENT-CENTERED CONSENT FRAMEWORK
**Dynamic Consent Protocol**
- Tiered consent forms with AI-specific disclosures
- Real-time consent tracking via patient portals
- Annual consent renewal requirements
- Right to human review override

**Informed Consent Requirements**
1. Plain language explanation of AI's role in care
2. Disclosure of accuracy rates by demographic group
3. Information about data usage and retention
4. Contact information for AI-related concerns

### 2. BIAS MITIGATION STRATEGIES
**Pre-Deployment Testing**
- Multi-site validation across diverse populations
- Minimum 95% accuracy across all demographic groups
- External fairness audit by third-party ethics board
- 90-day pilot with independent monitoring

**Continuous Monitoring**
- Real-time bias detection algorithms
- Quarterly fairness reports to oversight committees
- Patient demographic impact assessments
- Bias incident reporting system

**Technical Safeguards**
- Regular adversarial testing for bias
- Federated learning to protect patient privacy
- Differential privacy for training data
- Explainable AI requirements for clinical decisions

### 3. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
**Model Documentation Requirements**
- Public model cards with performance metrics
- Training data demographics and limitations
- Known failure modes and edge cases
- Update logs and version history

**Decision Transparency**
- Clinician-facing explanations for all AI recommendations
- Patient-accessible audit trails
- Clear demarcation between AI suggestions and final decisions
- Contradiction reporting when AI disagrees with clinicians

### 4. ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE
**Roles and Responsibilities**
- Chief AI Ethics Officer at each healthcare institution
- Multidisciplinary AI review boards (clinicians, ethicists, patients)
- Patient advocate representation in all AI governance
- Clear liability assignment for AI-related errors

**Training Requirements**
- Mandatory AI ethics training for all clinical staff
- Patient education materials about AI in healthcare
- Regular ethics case discussions in clinical meetings
- Continuing education credits for AI ethics training

### 5. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
**Phase 1 (0-6 Months)**
- Establish AI ethics committee
- Develop consent protocols
- Conduct baseline fairness audit

**Phase 2 (6-12 Months)**
- Implement bias monitoring systems
- Train clinical staff
- Launch patient education program

**Phase 3 (12-18 Months)**
- Full deployment with oversight
- Continuous improvement cycle
- Public reporting of outcomes

### 6. EVALUATION METRICS
**Fairness Metrics**
- Equal opportunity difference < 0.05
- Disparate impact ratio 0.8-1.2
- Demographic parity in false negative rates
- 95% patient satisfaction with AI explanations

**Clinical Outcomes**
- Reduction in diagnostic disparities
- Maintenance or improvement in accuracy
- No increase in time to treatment
- Improved patient understanding of care

### 7. EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS
**Fail-Safe Mechanisms**
- Immediate human override capability
- Rapid deactivation of problematic systems
- Emergency ethics consultation hotline
- Transparent communication of errors to affected patients

### CONCLUSION
These guidelines prioritize patient welfare while harnessing AI's potential to improve healthcare outcomes. Regular review and adaptation will ensure they remain effective as technology evolves.
