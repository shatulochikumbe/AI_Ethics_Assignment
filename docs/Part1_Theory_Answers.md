Part 1 theory answers

1. Short Answer Questions
Q1: Algorithmic Bias
Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and repeatable errors in AI systems that create unfair outcomes, often privileging certain groups while disadvantaging others. This bias typically stems from historical inequalities, unrepresentative data, or flawed model assumptions.

Examples:

Hiring Algorithms: Amazon’s recruitment tool downgraded resumes containing words like "women’s" (e.g., "women’s chess club captain") because it was trained on predominantly male historical hiring data.

Healthcare Allocation: An algorithm used in U.S. hospitals prioritized white patients over sicker Black patients for care management programs because it used healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs, ignoring disparities in healthcare access.

Q2: Transparency vs. Explainability

Transparency: Making the AI system’s design, data sources, and operational processes accessible and understandable to stakeholders (e.g., open-source code, documentation of training data).

Explainability: The ability to provide understandable reasons for specific decisions or predictions made by the AI system (e.g., "The loan was denied due to high debt-to-income ratio").

Importance: Transparency builds trust through accountability, while explainability enables users to challenge decisions, debug errors, and comply with regulations like GDPR’s "right to explanation."

Q3: GDPR Impact on AI Development
GDPR imposes strict requirements:

Lawful Basis: Requires explicit consent or legitimate interest for data processing.

Data Minimization: Limits data collection to what’s strictly necessary.

Right to Explanation: Grants individuals the right to understand automated decisions affecting them.

Privacy by Design: Mandates data protection from the initial design phase.
These rules increase development overhead but promote ethical AI practices.

2. Ethical Principles Matching
B) Non-maleficence: Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.

C) Autonomy: Respecting users’ right to control their data and decisions.

D) Sustainability: Designing AI to be environmentally friendly.

A) Justice: Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.
