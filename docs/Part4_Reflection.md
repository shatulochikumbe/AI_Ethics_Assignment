Part 4: Ethical Reflection
Personal Project: Educational Recommendation System

For my future project recommending learning resources to students, I will implement:

Diverse Training Data: Include representation across socioeconomic statuses, learning disabilities, and non-traditional education paths.

Explainable Recommendations: Provide clear reasons like "Recommended because you excelled in algebra" rather than black-box suggestions.

Continuous Monitoring: Track recommendation patterns quarterly for demographic disparities using fairness metrics.

Student Agency: Always allow opt-outs and manual overrides of recommendations.

I recognize that even well-intentioned systems can perpetuate tracking or stereotype threats, so I will collaborate with educational equity researchers throughout development.
