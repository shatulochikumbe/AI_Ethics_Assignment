COMPAS FAIRNESS AUDIT REPORT
============================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This audit of the COMPAS recidivism risk assessment system reveals significant racial disparities consistent with ProPublica's original findings. The system demonstrates systematic bias against African-American defendants across multiple fairness metrics.

KEY FINDINGS
1. **Disparate Impact**: The system shows a disparate impact ratio of 0.63 (below the 0.8 fairness threshold), indicating bias against the unprivileged group.

2. **False Positive Disparity**: African-American defendants are 2.0 times more likely to receive false high-risk predictions compared to Caucasian defendants. Specifically, 28.7% of African-Americans versus 14.5% of Caucasians are falsely labeled high risk.

3. **Equal Opportunity Violation**: The equal opportunity difference of -0.141 shows that Caucasian defendants have higher true positive rates, indicating the system is better at correctly identifying high-risk individuals within the privileged group.

4. **Prediction Disparity**: African-Americans are 1.9 times more likely to be predicted as high risk overall, despite similar or only moderately different actual recidivism rates.

METHODOLOGY
The audit analyzed 1,584 test cases using fairness metrics from the AI Fairness 360 toolkit. A logistic regression model was trained as a proxy for the COMPAS algorithm, and predictions were evaluated across racial groups.

ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS
These disparities raise serious ethical concerns:
- **Justice**: Unequal error rates violate principles of distributive justice
- **Transparency**: The proprietary nature of COMPAS limits auditability
- **Accountability**: No clear mechanism exists for correcting biased predictions

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. **Immediate Action**: Implement human review for all high-risk predictions
2. **Technical Fixes**: Apply bias mitigation techniques like reweighting or adversarial debiasing
3. **Policy Changes**: Establish regular fairness audits and transparent reporting
4. **System Design**: Consider rehabilitation-focused metrics rather than purely risk-based assessments

CONCLUSION
While algorithmic risk assessments aim to reduce human bias, this audit demonstrates they can perpetuate and amplify existing societal inequalities. Continuous monitoring, transparency, and ethical oversight are essential for responsible AI deployment in criminal justice.
